# Blackjack
Game developed within 1 month of learning C#.

The player can bet and keep playing until there is no more money left.

The most notable implementation is the ability to split at the beginning round and the coding of the different outcomes and hands comparison at the finishing round.

Instructions and rules are explained at the beginning.

The game was programmed following defensive coding practices.

An updated version of .NET Framework is needed.
